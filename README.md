# Custom Levels for Pogo Picross
Custom/bonus level packs, made by yours truly, for my Thumby game, [PogoPicross](https://github.com/PogostixWithAnX/PogoPicross)
(These are pretty useless on their own, so go check out the game)

## How to install:
Connect your Thumby to your computer, and either using Thonny or the [Thumby Code Editor](https://code.thumby.us/), upload the entire directory into the '/Games/PogoPicross/Levels/custom' directory. That's it, have fun!

## Can I make/share level packs?
YES! A tutorial can be found over [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LuCHmDHdNcXPD8UELjZ-VZ-BLbgADdSr3k3AZvKrtZ4/edit?usp=sharing)
